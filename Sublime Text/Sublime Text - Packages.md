# Sublime Text - Nice Packages

## Recommended for anyone

- A File Icon
    + Adds nice icons based on file type to the sidebar
- Bracket Highlighter
    + Highlights the matching bracket to the one selected, or the pair you currently inside
- Compare Side-by-side
    + Right-click on a file tab to compare it to the currently active tab. Highlights additions / deletions / differences.
- DocBlockr
    + Snippet Expansions to quickly create nice, readable comments to describe functions. Works well in JavaScript, PHP. Also has seperate plugin to add python support.
- GitGutter
    + Adds little green/red/yellow highlights next to each line of a file to show the diff between current and last commit.
- Gitignored file excluder
    + Any files ignored by the current git repo are grey-ed out in the sidebar, making it easier to see which files are and are not synced with the remote repo.
- Reindent:
    + Adds commands to re-indent the current file to 2 or 4 spaced indents.
- Sidebar Enhancements:
    + Adds a lot of useful options to the right-click menu for files/folders in the sidebar.
- WordCount
    + Adds a word and character count in the bottom-left of the Sublime window.


## Ones I use - might be useful to people 
- Advanced New File
    + Adds a bunch of customisable keyboard shortcuts to:
        * Create a new file at any path within the working directory
        * Rename or delete the existing file
- Markdown Editing
    + Nice shortcuts and syntax highlighter for editing .md files.
- Markdown Preview
    + View preview of compiled markdown file as you edit.
- Origami
    + Shortcuts to create / delete panels (side-by-side, above and below), and move files beetween each pane.
- Pretty Json:
    + Makes JSON human readable - and if it doesn't work, you know it's not correctly formatted json!
- RemoteSubl
    + If you have an SSH link open to a server with rsub installed, you can use rsub to edit the remote file in Sublime. (nicer than Nano or Vim to me)
- Terminus:
    + Adds a Command-line directly into Sublime. Takes a bit of setup to get it working well, but once setup you can use a keyboard shortcut to open a panel containing a terminal window at the root of your current working directory. 
- Text Pastry:
    + Lots of nice things to do with multiple cursors:
        * add incremental sequences into each cursor point;
        * generate random uuids
- Unicode Character Highlighter
    + Highlights weird characters like non-breaking spaces (i.e. things that are often hard to spot and that will likely break scripts!)
- xml2json
    + Converts between xml and json formatted data.


## Frontend Wed Dev
- Color Highlighter
    + Highlights hex-coded colours in the colour they represent. Can be cool, can be super hard to read.
- Emmet
    + Reaaaly useful for anyone writing lots of HTML. Expand css-style selectors into full html snippets.
    + e.g. `p.mt-5.p2` -> `<p class="mt-5 p2"></p>`


## For PHP development:
- Auto Semi-colon:
    + If you accidentally place a semi-colon inside a bracket, this plugin moves it to the outside.
- Php Companion:
    + Lots of nice shortcuts for PHP dev (e.g. adding properties to a class, adding correct `use` statements when using other classes  )
- Phpcs:
    + Code linter, tidyer for PHP. Requires some additional setup.

## Code Linting
Always good when your editor tells you when there's a syntax error in your code. There are lots of linter options - these are the ones I use.

- Sublime Linter
    + The base package for any linter.
- SublimeLInter-eslint
    + For JS, CSS
- SublimeLinter-json
    + For json
- SublimeLinter-php
    + For php

## Syntax Highlighting
Ones I have installed:

- Babel: For Javascript ES6 and React JSX
- INI: for .ini files.
- Powershell
- SASS
- TypeScript
- Vue Syntax Highlght
