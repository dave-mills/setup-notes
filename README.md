# Dev Notes
This repo is a set of links, notes, references on setting up computers for development.

DISCLAIMER: As with most tech-things, there are countless different ways to "setup your development environment". This is not a "definitive guide" or a declaration that the tools and methods of installation here are "the best" ways to do anything. The goal of this repo is simply to have a central reference point, so I don't have to copy out "how to install composer" to all my php-based project readmes. 

This is going to start off just as a bunch of markdown docs, possibly with some vague linking between them. It may get bigger over time and eventually graduate into something like a set of github site pages, or something else with a more formal structure. We shall see...
