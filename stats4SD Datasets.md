# Stats4SD Dataset Handling
This document defines how Stats4SD Staff should handle datasets that we receieve from clients and partners. It describes the use of the Stats4SD dataset tracker and how we can ensure that confidential data or datasets containing personal information are properly tracked during our work.

## The Dataset Tracker
Stats4SD has a dataset tracking tool. This tool provides a central location for us to store all datasets, and to track who takes copies of the datasets during the course of a project. It then allows the project leader to ensure that all versions of a dataset are removed from our systems at the end of a project.

**Accessing the tracker**
You can login to the dataset tracker at datasets.stats4sd.org. It authenticates you via your @stats4sd.org Microsoft Office 365 account.

**Linking your account to projects**
The Dataset tracker pulls in projects from FreeAgent. To access datasets for a specific project, you need to request access to that project. At present, you can request access by asking Lucia or Dave, and giving the names of the projects you need access to.

### Managing Datasets
Below are the steps you should follow when receiving and using datasets for a project:

**Receiving a dataset**

1. Collect all the files that comprise the dataset together.
    - It might be a single .csv file, but there may be multiple files, for e.g. the same data in different formats, or additional metadata files.
2. Go to the `Projects` page. Find your project and click the "Dataset" button in actions
